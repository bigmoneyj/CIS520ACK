---- PRELIMINARIES ----

>> Comments: Kadin Zimmerman, Chris Donnelly, Alex Johnson CIS520 project 1 submission.
             We did not try to do all of the MLFQS extra credit because this project was extremely hard, and 
             we didn't have time. 2 of the test cases are working though (mlfqs-fair-2 and mlfqs-fair-20)

                 ALARM CLOCK
                 ===========

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> A1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

    struct semaphore sema_sleep;  /* Semaphore used to implement alarm_clock */
        This helped us put the threads to sleep and wake them up.
    struct list_elem sleepelem;
        This helped us keep track of the sleeping threads
    struct list sleep_list;
        This is a list of the threads that are asleep.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe what happens in a call to your timer_sleep(),
>> including the effects of the timer interrupt handler.
    If the number of ticks is less than or eqal to 0, then we don't want to be sleeping, so we return.
    Otherwise, we want to put the thread to sleep for however many ticks specified through the function.
    When the timer interrup handler calls, we determine if the threads in sleep_list, are ready to wake up.

>> A3: What steps are taken to minimize the amount of time spent in
>> the timer interrupt handler?
    We created a sleep list, that way when we want to see if it is possible to wake a thread, we only check
    those that are sleeping, and not the ones that are waiting or currently running.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> A4: How are race conditions avoided when multiple threads call
>> timer_sleep() simultaneously?
    We disable interrupts to avoid the race conditions when multiple threads call timer_sleep() simultaneously.
    By putting locks around the critical section, we can only have one thread working at a time, and then we can 
    release the lock, allowing the other threads who are waiting to access the critical section next.

>> A5: How are race conditions avoided when a timer interrupt occurs
>> during a call to timer_sleep()?
    To avoid race conditions when a timer interrupt occurs during a call to timer_sleep(), we briefly disable interrupts
    before adding the thread to the waiting list, and then re-enable the interrupts after it has been added to the list.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A6: Why did you choose this design?  In what ways is it superior to
>> other designs that you considered?
    Originally we had a design where we were checking every thread to see if it was able to be woken back up. This design was not     good because in reality, we don't want to check the threads that are currently waiting, or running. So we re-implemented it      to check only those that are currently in a sleeping state. 


             PRIORITY SCHEDULING
             ===================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.
    
    struct semaphore sema_sleep;
        This is a semaphore for the sleeping thread
    struct list_elem donation_elem;
        This is a list element for the donation list
    struct list donor_list; 
        This is a list of the donation_elem above.
    struct lock *blocker;
        This is a lock of the blocker
        
>> B2: Explain the data structure used to track priority donation.
    The data structure used to track priority donation is the list of donors.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: How do you ensure that the highest priority thread waiting for
>> a lock, semaphore, or condition variable wakes up first?
    By placing the sleeping threads in a list ordered by priority. If the current thread has the lock, and has a priority
    which is lower than the thread waiting for the lock, then we need to do priority donation. We essentially swap the priorities
    of the current locked thread with the waiting thread, that way when the lock is released, the thread that was waiting will
    get it next.

>> B4: Describe the sequence of events when a call to lock_acquire()
>> causes a priority donation.  How is nested donation handled?
    A donation is needed when the current thread that has the lock, in which a higher priority thread needs the lock 
    in order to run. We first check the current thread's

>> on a lock that a higher-priority thread is waiting for.

              ADVANCED SCHEDULER [EXTRA CREDIT]
              =================================

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> C3: Did any ambiguities in the scheduler specification make values
